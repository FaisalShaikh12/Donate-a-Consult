# Donate-a-Consult
Utilized public datasets on healthcare access (1990â€“2019) and facility locations in Pakistan to create data visualizations that highlighted disparities in accessibility. Analyzed physician density trends in Pakistan and the United States, showcasing historical changes using statistical summaries and visual techniques such as scatter plots and smooth lines. Mapped healthcare facility locations in Pakistan to identify accessibility gaps, removing irrelevant data points (e.g., dentists) to refine insights. Created geographic visualizations using R libraries such as ggmap and ggplot2, overlaying facility locations on detailed maps for better interpretability.

Key contributions included preprocessing datasets to clean and standardize data, ensuring high-quality analysis. Developed interactive visualizations to present insights, including temporal trends in physician availability and spatial distribution of healthcare amenities. Applied advanced data manipulation techniques with tidyverse and geospatial mapping methods, demonstrating strong data processing and visualization skills.
